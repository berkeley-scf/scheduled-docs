This website demonstrates the functionality of `scheduled-docs`. Any documents with a date that is in the future will be set to `draft: true` and not appear in the listing below nor be accessible in search.

Change the `scheduled-docs:draft-after` field in `_quarto.yml` and re-render to experiment with the behavior.
